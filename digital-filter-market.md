<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infinite Impulse Response (IIR)</li><li>Finite Impulse Response (FIR)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital filter market is divided into two main types: Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. IIR filters use feedback to produce an infinite duration of output based on the input signal, allowing for efficient signal processing with fewer coefficients. In contrast, FIR filters have a finite response duration, making them inherently stable and easier to design. Both filter types have distinct applications, with IIR used in real-time systems and FIR favored for applications requiring linear phase response.</p></p>
