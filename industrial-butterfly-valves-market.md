<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Butterfly Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentric Butterfly Valves</li><li>Doubly-eccentric Butterfly Valves</li><li>Triply-eccentric Butterfly Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial butterfly valves market is categorized into three main types: concentric, doubly-eccentric, and triply-eccentric butterfly valves. Concentric butterfly valves feature a single shaft centered in the disc, ideal for general applications with lower pressure. Doubly-eccentric valves, or high-performance types, have the shaft positioned off-center, allowing for reduced wear and better sealing at higher pressures. Triply-eccentric valves further enhance efficiency with a third eccentric feature that minimizes friction and offers superior sealing, making them suitable for high-pressure and high-temperature applications.</p></p>
